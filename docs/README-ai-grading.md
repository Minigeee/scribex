# AI Grading Implementation

This document explains the AI grading system implemented for free-form exercises in the learning platform.

## Overview

The AI grading system uses a 5-level classification approach to evaluate student responses for:
- Fill-in-the-blank exercises
- Rewrite exercises
- Free response exercises

The system uses AI to provide detailed, contextual feedback and assigns scores based on a predefined scale.

## Grading Scale

The grading system uses the following scale:

| Grade Level | Description | Score |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Bad | Completely incorrect or fails to meet most criteria | 70% |
| Needs Improvement | Partially correct but with significant issues | 80% |
| Satisfactory | Meets most criteria with some issues | 90% |
| Good | Meets almost all criteria with minor issues | 95% |
| Excellent | Perfectly correct or meets all criteria exceptionally well | 100% |

An exercise is considered "completed" when the score is 90% or higher (Satisfactory or better).

## Implementation Details

### 1. Server-Side Grading Action

The grading logic is implemented in a server action (`src/app/actions/grade-exercise.ts`) that:
- Takes student responses and exercise context as input
- Constructs appropriate prompts for the AI model
- Parses the AI response to extract grade level and feedback
- Maps the grade level to a numeric score
- Handles errors gracefully with fallback grading

### 2. Exercise Component Integration

The `ExerciseItem` component has been updated to:
- Call the appropriate grading function based on exercise type
- Display a loading state during grading
- Show detailed AI feedback for each response
- Visually indicate correct/incorrect answers
- Store and display feedback for each question/response

### 3. Lesson Client Integration

The `LessonClient` component has been updated to:
- Handle the AI grading results
- Display appropriate toast notifications based on score
- Track exercise completion status
- Process rewards when all exercises are completed

## AI Prompt Design

Each exercise type uses a specialized prompt that includes:
1. Context about the exercise
2. Evaluation criteria
3. Example solutions (when available)
4. The student's response
5. Clear instructions for the AI to provide a grade and feedback

The prompts are designed to ensure consistent grading and helpful feedback.

## Technical Implementation

- Uses Google's Gemini model for grading (configurable)
- Implements error handling with fallback grading
- Provides detailed feedback for each response
- Uses a lower temperature setting (0.3) for more consistent grading
- Parses AI responses using regex to extract grade levels and feedback

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements to the grading system:
- Fine-tuning the AI model specifically for educational assessment
- Adding more granular feedback categories
- Implementing a feedback history to track student improvement
- Adding support for peer review alongside AI grading
- Implementing a human review option for contested grades
