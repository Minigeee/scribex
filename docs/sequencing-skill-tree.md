# Sequencing & Logic Skill Tree

This document outlines the skill tree for the Sequencing & Logic layer of writing instruction in ScribexX. This represents the second layer in the three-layer writing instruction model, focusing on argument structure, logical flow, and content generation.

## Skill Tree Overview

The Sequencing & Logic skill tree is designed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where students progress through increasingly complex concepts of organizing and structuring their writing.
